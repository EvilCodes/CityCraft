# CityCraft
A simple &amp; minified replication of towny in a beta version

This is a small plugin a server told me to create but it terminated it self before I could finish this project. 
Not that I found my old projects again I thought that open sourcing it wouldn't be a bad idea.
There is all in all just one thing left todo:
When creating a new city it should check if there is another city in a radius of x blocks.
I don't know how to solve this problem and I don't want to do it now. 
If you want you can use this project on your own server, customize it and tell people that it's yours.
It's open source!

Another problem: 
The messages.yml file is in german. Might add a english version later on.
